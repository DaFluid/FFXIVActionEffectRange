# ActionEffectRange

A FFXIV Dalamud plugin that provides a visual cue on the effect range of the AoE action the player has just used.

May be used as a supplement/replacement to the actions' VFXs in showing effect range related information, 
such as where has the action landed and how large an area it covered.


"""
The plugin is currently under development.

## Disclaimer

1. Because the visual cues are drawn on an overlay without any current context/knowledge about the in-game geographical features etc.,
   it can sometimes look distorted or "hovered in the air" depending on the terrain and/or camera angle.

2. There is no guarantee that things presented in the plugin will all be correct, 
   as I don't have full knowledge about every aspect of the actions' effect ranges and can possibly make mistakes or misunderstand things.
   There indeed are actions that I'm not quite sure about yet.


## Known Issues

- Blue Mage's action "Glass Dance": it's currently showing inaccurate effect range with several ugly shapes being drawn.
